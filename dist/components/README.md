#  Sample UI Components

Components are the basic building blocks of the Finsemble application. A component is a piece of HTML5/JavaScript that provides some functionality. Components that provide basic interface functionality are called UI components, e.g., a drop-down menu or dialog box. It's worth remembering that features like the toolbar or dropdown menus are just HTML5 windows operating with desktop application-like functionality.

Information about the presentation components can be found in our [documentation](https://documentation.chartiq.com/finsemble/tutorial-UIComponents.html).
