// This file contains the SharedWorker "thread" used to build the "SharedWorker"" router transport (see routerTransport.js), used
// by all router clients and the router service. It is typically at the center of Finsemble communications -- it provides the
// fastest communication between windows whenever the Openfin Bus transport isn't required for cross-domain communication.

// Event message between clients (i.e. Finsemble components and services) and the router service flow though here.
// Again, shared worker threads cannot communicate across domains or iFrames, so this is only for "local"" clients.
